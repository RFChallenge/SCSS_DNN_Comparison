# Single-Channel Source Separation: Preliminary Test of Neural Network Architectures

Using the demodulation challenge with a QPSK single-carrier channel as the signal-of-interest (SOI), and an OFDM (NFFT=64, Number of subcarriers=56 16-QAM symbols, Cyclic Prefix Length=16; similar to 802.11b specifications).
